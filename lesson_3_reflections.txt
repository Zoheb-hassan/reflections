When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When Collaborating with contributors remotely and also saving the work on cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To avoid conflicts that would come in from changes made by contributors

Whenevr we clone a repository git auutomatically adds a remote to it which can be checked via command git remote -v
The command for adding a remote is "git remote add origin url" and this adds the remote to which we can push/pull
For Pushing "git push origin master" will push the master branch to the remote on git
